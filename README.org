#+TITLE: egnuplot

=egnuplot= offers a macro named ~egnuplot~ to interact with real [[http://www.gnuplot.info][Gnuplot]], allowing you to build, manipulate, and run Gnuplot scripts entirely from Emacs Lisp. This library provides first-class integration of Lisp values, structures, and functions into Gnuplot plotting, making programmatic and repeatable data visualization seamless inside Emacs.

* Installation

First, you need to install [[http://gnuplot.info/][Gnuplot]], go check out its installation instructions for your operating system/distribution.


Download =egnuplot.el= file and put it into your =load-path=, afterwards you can simply do the following in your =init.el=:

#+begin_src elisp
(require 'egnuplot)
#+end_src

Another way to install =egnuplot= would be using either [[https://github.com/radian-software/straight.el][straight]] or [[https://github.com/quelpa/quelpa-use-package][quelpa]] package managers:

#+begin_src elisp
;; Using straight:
(use-package egnuplot
  :straight (:host github :repo "isamert/egnuplot"))

;; Using quelpa:
(use-package egnuplot
  :quelpa (egnuplot
           :fetcher github
           :repo "isamert/egnuplot"))
#+end_src

* Features

- Write Gnuplot scripts in Emacs Lisp, with native Elisp values and logic.
- Generate and render plots by calling Gnuplot in the background.
- Compose and reuse plot data, curves, and settings as Lisp code.
- Easily parameterize and automate plot generation.

* Thinking in ~egnuplot~

Essentially, ~egnuplot~ automatically converts your forms into Gnuplot scripts, aiming to make the interaction between Emacs Lisp and Gnuplot as smooth and effortless as possible.

Let's see an example:

#+begin_src elisp
(let ((myfile "/tmp/simple.png"))
  (egnuplot
   (set terminal 'pngcairo 'size [800 400])
   (set output myfile)
   (table $triangle '((0 0) (1 1) (2 0)))
   (plot (curve $triangle 'with 'linespoints 'title "A Triangle"))))
#+end_src

This will be converted into the following script:

#+begin_src elisp
set terminal pngcairo size 800,400
set output "/tmp/simple.png"
$triangle << EOD
0 0
1 1
2 0
EOD
plot $triangle with linespoints title "A Triangle"
#+end_src

There are some special rules and forms that makes interoperability much easier, see the [[Conversion guideline]] section down below.

* Examples

Basic plot:

#+begin_src elisp :results file :exports both
(egnuplot
 (set terminal 'pngcairo 'size [300 300])
 (set output ".assets/triangle.png")
 (table $triangle '((0 0) (1 1) (2 0)))
 (plot (curve $triangle 'with 'linespoints 'title "Triangle")))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
[[file:.assets/triangle.png]]

Functions, styles, and math in plots:

#+begin_src elisp :results file :exports both
(egnuplot
 (set terminal 'pngcairo 'size [400 300])
 (set output ".assets/functions.png")
 (set style 'line 1 'linecolor 'rgb "#0060ad" 'linetype 1 'linewidth 2)
 (defconst a "0.9")
 (defun f (x) "a * sin(x)")
 (defun g (x) "a * cos(x)")
 (plot
  (curve (raw "f(x)") 'title "sin(x)" 'with 'lines 'linestyle 1)
  (curve (raw "g(x)") 'title "cos(x)" 'with 'lines 'linestyle 2)))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
[[file:.assets/functions.png]]

Generating data with Elisp:

#+begin_src elisp :results file :exports both
(egnuplot
 (set terminal 'pngcairo :size [300 300])
 (set output ".assets/elisp.png")
 (table $expdata (mapcar (lambda (x) (list x (exp (- (* x x)))))
                         (number-sequence -4.0 4.0 0.1)))
 (plot (curve $expdata 'using (raw "1:2") 'with 'lines 'title "exp(-x^2)")))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
[[file:.assets/elisp.png]]

Generating a more complex plot with Elisp functions and directly displaying it in Emacs buffer:

#+begin_src elisp
(let ((svg (egnuplot
            (set terminal 'svg)
            (set border 'linewidth 1.5)
            (set title "A Trio of Functions")
            (set key 'outside)
            (set xlabel "x")
            (set ylabel "y")
            (set style :line 1 :linecolor 'rgb "#1f77b4" :linetype 1 :linewidth 2)
            (set style :line 2 :linecolor 'rgb "#ff7f0e" :linetype 2 :linewidth 2 :dashtype 2)
            (set style :line 3 :linecolor 'rgb "#2ca02c" :linetype 3 :linewidth 2 :dashtype 3)
            (table $data (mapcar (lambda (x)
                                   (list x
                                         (exp (- (* x x)))                             ; e^{-x^2}
                                         (if (zerop x) 1 (/ (sin x) x))                ; sinc(x)=sin(x)/x
                                         (* (cos (* 2 x)) (exp (/ (- (* x x)) 2.0))))) ; cos(2x)·e^{-x^2/2}
                                 (number-sequence -4.0 4.0 0.1)))
            (plot
             (curve $data :using (raw "1:2") :with 'lines :title "exp(-x^2)" :linestyle 1)
             (curve $data :using (raw "1:3") :with 'lines :title "sinc(x)"   :linestyle 2)
             (curve $data :using (raw "1:4") :with 'lines :title "cos(2x)·exp(-x^2/2)" :linestyle 3)))))
  (insert-image (create-image svg 'svg t)))
#+end_src

* Conversion guideline

- Symbols and Strings ::
  - Lisp symbols become Gnuplot identifiers or keywords. For example, ='thing= or =:thing= becomes =thing=.
  - Strings are rendered as Gnuplot strings, e.g. ="output.png"= stays ="output.png"=.

- Vectors ::
  - Vectors are comma-joined. =[800 400]= becomes =800,400=. Alternatively you can do ~800\,400~ but escaping commas become tedious.
  - *Single-element vectors* are displayed as =[value]=, for compatibility with Gnuplot range syntax.

    #+begin_src elisp
    [800 400]    ; becomes 800,400
    [-2*pi:2*pi] ; becomes [-2*pi:2*pi]
    #+end_src

- Raw Gnuplot ::
  - You can insert raw Gnuplot code anywhere using =(raw "text")=.
    This is useful if you need to use an exact Gnuplot syntax (for tics, formulas, or feature coverage):

    #+begin_src elisp
    (set xtics (raw "('-2π' -2*pi, '-π' -pi, 0, 'π' pi, '2π' 2*pi)"))
    #+end_src

- Variables starting with =$= ::
  - When you use symbols like =$data=, they’re emitted as-is into the script (useful for referencing Gnuplot tables and blocks, this only happens in =table=, =data= and =curve= special forms):

  #+begin_src elisp
  (table $data '((0 0) (1 1) (2 0)))
  (plot (curve $data 'with 'linespoints))
  #+end_src

- raw :: For anything egnuplot doesn’t cover, just emit the original Gnuplot code:

  #+begin_src elisp
  (raw "trim(\"  some string  \")")
  #+end_src

* Special Forms

- set :: Sets a Gnuplot option, mapping directly to =set ...=:

  #+begin_src elisp
  (set terminal 'pngcairo 'size [800 400])
  (set output "plot.png")
  #+end_src

- table :: Defines an inline Gnuplot data block from a list of data:

  #+begin_src elisp
  (table $triangle '((0 0) (1 1) (2 0)))
  #+end_src

- data :: Like ~table~, directly constructed from strings:

  #+begin_src elisp
  (data $triangle
        "0 0"
        "1 1"
        "2 0")

  ;; Don't forget that these are Elisp functions, meaning you can do:

  (apply #'data $triangle '("1 0" "1 1" "2 0"))
  #+end_src

- curve :: Defines a plot curve. Used within ~plot~ form. Use inline data, functions, or references (=$data=, etc.):

  #+begin_src elisp
  (curve $triangle 'with 'lines 'title "Triangle")
  (curve (raw "sin(x)") 'title "sin(x)")
  #+end_src

- plot :: Plot given curves.

  #+begin_src elisp
  (plot
   (curve $data 'with 'linespoints)
   (curve $triangle 'with 'lines 'title "Triangle")
   (curve (raw "sin(x)") 'title "sin(x)"))

  ;; Advanced example:

  (let ((files '("file1.csv" "file2.csv" "file3.csv")))
    (egnuplot
     ;; ...
     (apply #'plot (mapcar
                    (lambda (file)
                      (curve file 'with 'lines 'title (concat file "'s line")) )
                    datas))))
  #+end_src

- defconst, defun :: Inject Gnuplot user variables and functions:

  #+begin_src elisp
  (defconst a "0.9")
  (defun f (x) "a*sin(x)")
  #+end_src

- raw :: For anything egnuplot doesn’t cover, just emit the original Gnuplot code:

  #+begin_src elisp
  (raw "trim(\"  some string  \")")
  #+end_src

- run :: Similar to raw but can work with Elisp data types:

  #+begin_src elisp
  (run 'unset 'grid) ;; → unset grid
  #+end_src

- comment :: Insert comments in the generated Gnuplot script:

  #+begin_src elisp
  (comment "This is a comment in the Gnuplot script")
  #+end_src

- unset, reset :: Works as you expect.

  #+begin_src elisp
  (unset grid)
  (reset)
  #+end_src
